# The OU Superscript/subscript editor

This is a simple text input widget that lets users edit one line of input
with superscripts and subscripts, for use in Moodle.

## Installation

This plugin should be compatible with Moodle 3.4+. Older versions are
available if you need to support older versions of Moodle.

Install from the Moodle plugins database https://moodle.org/plugins/editor_ousupsub.

Or you can install using git. Type this commands in the root of your Moodle install
    git clone git://github.com/moodleou/moodle-editor_ousupsub.git lib/editor/ousupsub

## History

This editor was created by Colin Chambers of the Open University
http://www.open.ac.uk/.

The code for this editor was heavily inspired by the Atto editor built into Moodle.

It was created for use with several of our question types:

* https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_pmatch
* https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_varnumeric
* https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_varnumericset
* https://moodle.org/plugins/qtype_varnumunit

## Functionality

The purpose of this editor is to make it as easy as possible for users to intput
text with superscripts and/or subscripts, while keeping things as simple as possible
and keeping the results HTML as clean as possible.

* Allow only alphanumeric text. No html tags except <sup> and <sub>
* Provide a superscript or subscript button or both along with related functionality
* Prevent nesting of superscript and subscript tags
* No text wrapping is allowed along with no paragraphs. Everything is on one line
* Configurable height and width of editor
* Provide a standalone version of the same editor for offline situations such as e-readers
* Editor can placed where required including inline with text

## Standalone version

More details are in readme_standalone.txt that gets added to the /standalone folder
A standalone/offline version of the editor is also provided in the /standalone folder. This provides all the
functionality of the editor in a package that works in an ereader or mobile app or on a desktop to demonstrate
the functionality of the editor outside of moodle. There feature is currently in beta.

The standalone version is kept up to date by running the buildstandalone.php in the same way you run a behat script
The full command we use is php lib/editor/ousupsub/buildstandalone.php

Running this script outputs a list of files and features that have been created. First it deletes the contents of the
standalone folder and then it recreates the standalone files. This ensures the standalone version is as up to date with
the plugin. This task is performed during development of the editor. If you are using it out of the box you shouldn't
need to run this script.

## Testing

Automated testing is through behat and custom javascript unit tests. There is a behat test for the moodle plugin and an
identical test for the standalone version

The javascript unit tests run in a browser. Load /tests/fixtures/testcleanup.html in a specific browser to see if the
tests pass in that browser.

The editor will work any where moodle editors work but it's designed to be used with specific OU question types
The main places to test are:
* pattern match questions (OU specific question type)
* variable numeric  questions (OU specific question type)

## HTML Output

To understand exactly what this editor will and will not do it's best to understand the HTML it will or will not allow.
That is described in the behat tests at tests/behat/ousupsub.feature. You do not need to understand web development
to understand these tests and you don't have to be able to run them either.

Here is a simple example we tell the browser what to do. Select the whole of the word "subscript". In behat we write
    # Apply subscript
    When I select the range "'',16,'',25" in the "Description" ousupsub editor

Then we ask the brower to apply subscript to the word we have selected
    And I click on "Subscript" "button"

Then we check that subscript was applied correctly.
    Then I should see "Superscript and <sub>Subscript</sub>" in the "Description" ousupsub editor

That is how you read the behat tests and how you know what to expect the editor to do.

## Third-party code

Thanks to the creators of the rangy software library, which we use.

1)  Rangy (version 1.2.3)
    * Download the latest stable release;
    * Copy the content of the 'currentrelease/uncompressed' folder into yui/src/rangy/js
    * Run shifter against yui/src/rangy

    Notes:
    * We have patched 1.2.3 with a backport fix from the next release of Rangy which addresses an incompatibility
      between Rangy and HTML5Shiv which is used in the bootstrapclean theme. See MDL-44798 for further information.
